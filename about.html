				<h1>About</h1>
				<div>
					<p>
						GreenB is a small company set up by two bicycle fans, Paul and Peter, in the year 2006. Paul used to be an engineer
						and he invented a very light folding electronic bicycleâ€”weighing only 9Kg and using the same batteries as those used
						in mobile phones and laptops. Peter used to be a designer in an air-conditioning company. He applied his expertise to
						design the bicycle in a way that is highly functional but yet both fashionable and colourful. The company outsources all
						the parts of the bicycle to various manufacturers and assembles finished bicycles in their garage. To protect their
						product, GreenB has been patented. The product is very popular among commuters. Because the product is super
						light, it can be easily transported in trains and buses. <br><br>
						The uniqueness of the GreenB lies not in its ultra-lightness but also its fun for riding and oozes a new lifestyle. While
						the traditional battery-operated bikes are comparatively heavy and big and perceived as a dull transportation tool, the
						GreenB provides functions well beyond just a transportation tool but for greeness and sustainability. Because of its
						unique design, its users believe they are contributing to reduce negative human impact on our planet.
						The GreenB can be used on pedals alone, on electric power alone, or combined. The ultra-small design of the bike
						makes it easy to be ridden on almost every occasion and in combination with other means of transportation. Most
						users ride it to commute to work.
